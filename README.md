# Landslide App
>*NASA Space Apps Challenge - 2017*

## Introduction
This is a web application project made for NASA Space Apps Challenge - 2017. It solves the When "Landslide Strike" problem under "Warning! Danger Ahead!" category.
## Main Concept
We are presenting a web app called "Landslide App". It helps to get landslide dta of nasa. This app can show you the nasa data of lanslide with the easiest process. This app is also able to show you the visualized data. Even someone can upload the latest data here.
## Description
Every year more than thousand people are killed by landslides. We cannot underestimate the lives taken by landslides. Thus we need to know about landslides, learn about past landslide events and analyse them. So that we can predict future landslide events and save some lives and property. Team DPI-Decoder presents the world the “Landslide App” which helps us to discover Landslide data provided by NASA. Also visualize and analyse those to learn and understand landslides. People can also contribute with recent landslide events data.
